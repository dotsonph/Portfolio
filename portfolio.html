            You found me! For some background, I graduated from George Mason University with a <strong>B.S Computer Engineering</strong> degree in the May 2024 class<br> 
            with an <strong>Embedded Systems Concentration</strong>. Throughout my undergrad, I focused on <strong>Embedded Software Development</strong> and <strong>FPGAs</strong>. <br>
            In other words, a lot of work with different microprocessors/development boards</strong> paired with Xilinx Vivado, Linux Shells, and various IDEs.<br>
            Although most of my coursework prioritized computer architecture and lower-level programming, I enjoy really <em>all</em> electrical/software disciplines.<br><br>                
            
            This includes <strong>RF, Electronics, Kernel Driver Development, GPU Programming, Ethical Hacking, Video Game Development</strong>... You get the point.<br>                
            I simply <em>dislike</em> the idea of limiting myself in terms of a professional career within any particular field. I suppose I am just an unsatisfied learner.<br>
            Realistically, I would love to work anywhere with opportunity to grow and internal career flexibility starting off in firmware and/or software development.<br> 
            Having said everything, I am by no means opposed to pursuing other fields dabbling in RF, web development, cybersecurity, etc... Who knows what else!<br>

                Now what am I working on you may ask? Well, this website for one. I had absolutely zero exposure to full-stack development in my undergrad.<br>
                I can actually link the <a target = " blank" href = "index.html">first HTML document</a> with trash and jargon I compiled while learning just last recently. It is safe to say there has been progress.<br>

                So I basically spent time after graduating trying to hammer up this portfolio and a half-decent GitHub <strong id="git" style="color:rgb(68, 158, 55);">/** more on this for later **/</strong>.<br>
                Thankfully a few tutorials, books, and blogs had me up and running in days, learning <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and some simple <strong>Javascript</strong>. Eventually I want<br>
                to learn popular, accomodating libraries and frameworks like React, Node,js, Vue.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and others I definitely missed.<br> 
                Basically, this website that you are looking at right now may not exist once I acquire more experience and decide to hit the restart button.<br>

                Now onto the more interesting business, I have spent quite some time learning <b>Video Game Development</b> which consisted of choosing an engine,<br>
                learning its proprietary language, and really just understanding the software's layout and full feature set. I decided to pick up Godot for
