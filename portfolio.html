                You found me! For some background, I recently graduated from George Mason University last May with a <strong>B.S Computer Engineering</strong> degree <br> 
                with a <strong>concentration in Embedded Systems</strong>. Throughout my undergrad, I focused on <strong>Embedded Software Development</strong> and <strong>FPGAs</strong>. <br>
                In other words, a lot of work with different microprocessors/development boards</strong> paired with Xilinx Vivado, Linux Shells, and various IDEs.<br>
                Although most of my coursework prioritized computer architecture and lower-level programming, I enjoy really <em>all</em> electrical/software disciplines.<br><br>                
                
                This includes <strong>RF, Electronics, Kernel Driver Development, GPU Programming, Ethical Hacking, Video Game Development</strong>... You get the point.<br>
                I simply <em>loathe</em> the idea of boxing myself in when it comes to a professional career and any particular path. I suppose I am just an unsatisfied learner.<br>
                Realistically, I would love to work anywhere with long-term opportunity to grow and career flexibility in firmware and/or software development. Having<br> 
                said everything, I am by no means opposed to pursuing other fields such as RF engineering, cybersecurity, AI/ML, etc... Who knows what will happen!
