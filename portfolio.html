            You found me! For some background, I recently graduated from George Mason University last May with a <strong>B.S Computer Engineering</strong> degree <br> 
            with a <strong>concentration in Embedded Systems</strong>. Throughout my undergrad, I focused on <strong>Embedded Software Development</strong> and <strong>FPGAs</strong>. <br>
            In other words, a lot of work with different microprocessors/development boards</strong> paired with Xilinx Vivado, Linux Shells, and various IDEs.<br>
            Although most of my coursework prioritized computer architecture and lower-level programming, I enjoy really <em>all</em> electrical/software disciplines.<br><br>                
            
            This includes <strong>RF, Electronics, Kernel Driver Development, GPU Programming, Ethical Hacking, Video Game Development</strong>... You get the point.<br>                
            I simply <em>loathe</em> the idea of boxing myself in when it comes to a professional career and any particular path. I suppose I am just an unsatisfied learner.<br>
            Realistically, I would love to work anywhere with long-term opportunity to grow and career flexibility in firmware and/or software development. Having<br> 
            said everything, I am by no means opposed to pursuing other fields such as RF engineering, cybersecurity, AI/ML, etc... Who knows what will happen!<br>

            Now what am I working on you may ask? Well, this website for one. Given my background, I had zero exposure to frontend development in my undergrad.<br>
            I might have been exposed to a scripting language early on in my highschool days, however, <em>none</em> of that knowledge was retained. Not a single line or bracket.<br>
            I can actually show below the first HTML document with trash and jargon I compiled while learning just last week. It is safe to say there has been progress.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            So I basically spent time after graduating trying to hammer up this portfolio and a half-decent GitHub <strong id="git" style="color:rgb(27, 200, 0);">/** more on this for later **/</strong>.<br>
            Thankfully a few tutorials and blogs had me up and running in days, learning <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and some extremely simple <strong>Javascript</strong>. Eventually I want<br>
            to learn popular, accomodating frameworks like React, Vue.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and others I missed. The issue is sometimes I get caught in the habit of<br>
            not starting something just because I feel inadequately equipped to create something "great". And that is why it took me till now to start at all... <br>
            Basically, that will be my excuse if this website of mine appears occasionally half-baked while I do my regular tweaks.<br>
            There is a lot for me to learn and implement overtime that is.<br>
